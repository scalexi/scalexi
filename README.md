# scalexi Python API  

_Simplifying LLM Development and Fine-Tuning with Python_


# Overview

[![PyPI version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/scalexi.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/scalexi/)

`scalexi` is a versatile open-source Python library, optimized for Python 3.11+, focuses on facilitating low-code development and fine-tuning of diverse Large Language Models (LLMs). It extends beyond its initial OpenAI models integration, offering a scalable framework for various LLMs.

Key to `scalexi` is its low-code approach, significantly reducing the complexity of dataset preparation and manipulation. It features advanced dataset conversion tools, adept at transforming raw contextual data into structured datasets fullfilling LLMs fine-tuning requirements. These tools support multiple question formats, like open-ended, closed-ended, yes-no, and reflective queries, streamlining the creation of customized datasets for LLM fine-tuning.

A standout feature is the library's automated dataset generation, which eases the workload involved in LLM training. `scalexi` also provides essential utilities for cost estimation and token counting, aiding in effective resource management throughout the fine-tuning process.

Developed by [scalexi.ai](https://scalexi.ai/), the library leverages a robust [OpenAPI specification](http://docs.scalexi.ai/) to facilitate fine-tuning context-specific models with OpenAI API. Incorporating both synchronous and asynchronous capabilities with support from [httpx](https://github.com/encode/httpx), `scalexi` ensures a user-friendly experience while maintaining high performance.

Explore the full capabilities of Large Language Models with `scalexi`'s intuitive and efficient Python API with minimal coding.
